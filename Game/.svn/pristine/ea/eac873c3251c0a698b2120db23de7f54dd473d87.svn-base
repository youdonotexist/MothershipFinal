MASTER AUDIO PLUGIN - By DarkTonic, Inc. (c) 2012-2013 

- Code by Brian Hunsaker

-V 3.0.1 - Added Master Audio 3D Gizmo (M icon) to all Variations. Only useful if you "attach to caller". Always on.
	 - Added toggle-able 3D Gizmo for Event Sounds component as well. Defaults to on.
	 - Added Variation Mode and Variation Name so you can play a specific Variation by name with Event Sounds.
	 - Fixed bug where adjusting Group, Bus or Mixer volume would give you warnings about null Audio Sources.
	 - Made all Playlist Controllers static - first step toward multiple Playlist Controllers.
	 - Removed support for non-Playlist Controller simple music ducker (sorry to the one person who is using this).
	 - Moved Ducked Volume Multiplier property into Master Audio prefab. You will lose your value for this when you update, so take note of it.
	 - Moved Cross-fade Time (playlist) into Master Audio prefab. You will lose your value for this when you update, so take note of it.
	 - Moved Master Playlist Volume into Master Audio prefab. You will lose your value for this when you update, so take note of it.
	 - Removed all unnecessary static variables - this is a code optimization and will improve memory usage!

-V 3.0.0 - Added playlist "Jukebox" up top on Master Audio prefab at runtime only, with pause, next, play, random, and playlist selection buttons. Also shows what's playing and cross-fading.
	 - Added LED's that light up briefly on the mixer for each Sound Group each time a Variation in that Group starts playing.
	 - Added full undo support to every Inspector action (Unity 4.3+ only).

	 - Changed delay sound code so it works on Unity V3.5.7 as well!
	 - You can now turn on debug logs during play.
	 - When bus is muted, don't allow muting or soloing of any of the those sound groups. That way the bus mute status and bus solo status are preserved and not partially muted or soloed. Logs a warning so you know what's happening.
	 - When putting a group into a muted or soloed bus, the group gets soloed or muted automatically as appropriate via the bus.
	 - Changed Master Audio Volume label to Master Mixer Volume.
	 - Added playlist volume to MA prefab at top under Master Mixer Volume. 
	 - Added Playlist Cross-fade time to Playlist settings on MA prefab.
	 - Can now adjust ducking volume multiplier in real-time.
	 - Added ducked vol multiplier to ducking section on MA prefab.
	 - Now no reason to ever have to go to the Playist Controller prefab! Its controls are on MA prefab.
	 - Made section up at top with Mute Mixer button (all Sound Groups).

	 - Added new bus commands to Event Sounds for no-code triggering.
	 - Added new bus commands to Playmaker Custom Actions for no-code triggering.
	 - Variations now automatically re-parent back to the Sound Group when finished playing or stopped (if not looped).
	 - Added AdjustVolume method to Variations which can be used to adjust the volume of a sound already playing, taking into account the bus, group and mixer volume.
	 - Added convenience "lazy load" properties for the 6 Unity Filter SFX to the Variation object. You can access them after playing a sound.

	 - Added all Bus functions to EventSounds for no-code control of Buses as well (fade, pause, unpause)!
	 - Added "Looped Chain" variation mode to Sound Groups. It will act as a mini-playlist and randomly play all clips in a looped fashion if selected.

-V 2.8.8 - Fixed warning for Start sound in Event Sounds when playing a sound from DSGC.
	 - Fixed bug where Dynamic Sound Groups would throw an error on non-Resource clips being removed on Scene change.
 	 - Fixed bug where Dynamic Sound Group Resource clips would not be loaded the 2nd time you visit the same scene.
 	 - Added SoundGroupExists method to check for completion of Dynamic SGC groups. Used by Event Sounds script.

	 - Added "Song Transition Type" for Playlists. Choices are "new song from beginning" and "Synchronize clips". If you choose Synchronize clips, going to next or random song will start the new clip at the same position (time) the previous clip was at.

-V 2.8.6 - Memory usage improvements!
	   1) Audio played from Resource files is now loaded only when played in the Variation, simultaneously into all Variations that reference it. When none are using it anymore, it is unloaded from memory.
	   2) Variations are now stopped after completion (they were showing up as playing still in the 3.5.7 Profiler. Weird I know).
	 - Removed auto-capitalization of Sound Groups and Variations.
	 - Fixed bug where Destroying an object with a Variation childed under it would destroy the Variation.
	 - Small breaking change: Changed DetectSoundFinished delegate notification. Check the documentation for new way.
